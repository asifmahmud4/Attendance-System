# Attendance-System
"Students can use a special system to say they're in class without using paper."
"This system helps you remember when you were in class and keeps things neat."
"It's like a cool way to say, 'Hey, I'm here and ready to learn!'"
"No more losing sheets â€“ use tech to show you're present."
"The system makes it easy to see how often you come to class."
"It's a simple way to be responsible and show you're part of the learning group."
"This system makes attendance easy, just a quick tap and you're done."
"Say bye to old attendance and hi to a modern and easy way of keeping track!"
